# Smart_Crop_Recommendation_System
## 📌 Project Overview
Smart Crop Recommendation System is an AI-based tool that helps farmers in Pakistan choose the most suitable and profitable crop using soil and weather data such as pH, rainfall, temperature, and humidity. It supports data-driven farming to improve yield, reduce risk, and promote sustainable agriculture.
This project is built from scratch without using pre-trained deep learning models, focusing on the fundamental mathematics of Machine Learning algorithms.

## 📅 Weekly Progress Log

### ✅ Week 1: Foundation, Data Pipeline & Exploration
**Status:** Completed
**Key Activities:**
- **Dataset Acquisition:** Downloaded the "Crop Recommendation Dataset" from Kaggle (2200 rows, 22 crop types).
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Checked for missing values (dataset is clean).
  - Analyzed statistical properties of soil features (N, P, K, Temperature, etc.).
- **Visualization:**
  - Created a **Correlation Heatmap** to understand relationships between environmental factors.
- **Data Pipeline:**
  - Implemented an **80-20 Train-Test Split** to prepare data for modeling.
  - Verified the shape of Training (1760 samples) and Testing (440 samples) sets.
- **Documentation:**
  - Uploaded the initial project proposal and timeline.
